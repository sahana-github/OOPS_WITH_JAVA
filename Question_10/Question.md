Define an interface ‘Department’ with methods to readdata() and printdata(),
print_number_designations(), number_research_consultancy_projs(). Define a ‘Faculty’
class with members name, designation, age, years of experience, joining_date and
subjects_handled.
a. In package ISE define the ‘ISE_department’ class that implements the
‘Department’ interface, accepts n faculty details and define all the methods.
Raise a user defined exception ‘AgeException’ if the age of the faculty is > 58.
b. In the default package define a ‘MainClass’ which uses the methods of the
above classes and also displays those faculty details whose years of experience
is greater than or equal to 20.
